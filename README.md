# Future Normalization of North American Fire Extremes

This repository contains the code supporting the paper "Was Canada's 2023 fire season a preview of things to come in North America?" by Kaiwei Luo, Xianli Wang, Dante Castellanos-Acuna, and Mike Flannigan.

## Overview

This research quantifies how North America's diurnal burning windows—specifically Active Burning Day potential (ABDp) and Overnight Burning Event potential (OBEp)—will evolve under climate change. 
By linking satellite observations (GOES-R) with CMIP6 climate models via machine learning, we assess whether recent catastrophic fire seasons (Canada 2023 and Western U.S. 2020/2021) are statistical outliers or the "new normal"



## Workflow and Code Organization

### 1. Data Processing and Algorithms

This section includes the initial data preparation and processing of GOES satellite data:

- **01_Download.R**: Downloads GOES-16, GOES-17, and GOES-18 active fire products.
- **02_Processing.R**: Processes raw GOES active fire detection data.
- **03_Projecting.R**: Projects the processed data to consistent geographic coordinates.
- **04_hourly_extract_fire weather_2017_2023.R**: Identifies hourly fire diurnal cycles and extracts corresponding hourly fire weather.
- **05_NA_daily_extract_fire weather_2017_2023.R**: Extracts and calculates daily fire weather metrics.
- **06_daily combo_hourly combo_goes combo.R**: Combine hourly and daily extractions.

### 2. Active Burning Hours (ABH) Analysis (2017-2023)

Analysis of observed hourly fire activity using R scripts:

- **01_daily_fire_pattern_statistics.R**: Analyzes daily fire patterns and statistics across North America.
- **02_burning_duration_intensity_analysis.R**: Examines the relationship between burning duration and fire intensity.
- **03_spatial_seasonal_burning_patterns.R**: Investigates spatial and seasonal burning patterns.
- **04_spatial_visualization.R**: Creates spatial visualizations of burning hour patterns.
- **05_biome_seasonal_analysis.R**: Analyzes burning patterns by biome and season.
- **06_nighttime_burning_analysis.R**: Focuses on nighttime burning.

### 3. Potential Burning Hours (PHB) Analysis (1975-2024)

Long-term analysis of potential burning hours using Python scripts:

- **01_hourly_fire_model_training.py**: Trains the random forest model for predicting hourly fire probability.
- **02_hourly_fire_potential_prediction.py**: Applies the model to historical weather data to predict potential burning hours.
- **03_hourly_model_prediction_summary.py**: Summarizes hourly predictions into annual and seasonal metrics.
- **04_annual_trend_analysis.py**: Analyzes long-term trends in annual potential burning hours.
- **05_seasonal_trend_analysis.py**: Examines seasonal trends in potential burning hours.
- **06_daily_active_pattern_analysis.py**: Analyzes patterns in potential active days and daily burning hours.
- **07_extreme_hours_analysis.py**: Focuses on trends in extreme burning hour events (12+ and 24-hour events).
- **08_biome_analysis.py**: Analyzes trends by biome to understand ecosystem-specific patterns.

## Key Findings

- Western mountains and boreal forests experienced the longest active burning hours, with ~one-third of active days exceeding 12 ABH.
- About 60% of fires reached peak intensity within 24 hours of detection, while 14% of active days peaked at night.
- Annual potential burning hours (PBH) rose 36% across North America's burnable areas over 1975–2024.
- Western regions saw the most pronounced increases, with spring and fall seasons showing 48–57% increases.
- Areas with significant changes gained 26 more potential active days annually and 1.2 additional potential burning hours daily.
- Extreme PBH days (12+ hours/day) increased by 81-255% in fire-prone biomes.
